			<p>College life💓, It all started with one hot Summer. That was the time where we released our school board examination pressure and ready to take up college pressure.<br><br>

I still remember the first day of college. Buckling up new pair of shoes, new dresses and that excitement and nervousness to face new beginning of life.<br><br>

College days are the most important days of life. Usually we may forget our syllabus we studied but not friendship and memories we gained when we study college.<br><br>

The beginning of college will  be bored with new teacher who comes to class teaches us something, again a new teacher and it goes on the whole day.<br><br>

Then we try to make some friends out there in college. Some friendship will be like passing cloud and some will blend into our life.<br><br>

Wanna know how beautiful the college life is??<br>
It’s all about ,<br><br>

Nicknames 😜 to Last Bench Games🎊<br><br>

Cultural Rehearsals 😎 to Love Proposals 😍<br><br>

Short term Crushes 😘 to Classroom Blushes ☺️<br><br>

Last minute preparation 😰 to passing an examination 😎<br><br>

Project Reviews to Campus Interviews<br><br>

Everything little thing we experience will be fresh in our mind even after the college life gets over.<br><br>

We all will be in elation👬🎉<br>
Till that painful moment of separation💔<br><br>

We all will face the time to part💔<br>
Which makes us to leave the college life  with a heavy heart💝<br><br><br>

<em>
	So friends, if you are going start a college life. I swear, it will be fun. Don’t miss it. And to fellows who are already in college, HOLD ON!! MAKE MEMORIES!!<br>
Coz, Memories are always special..! Sometimes we laugh by remembering the days we cried, and we cry by remembering the days that we laughed.<br>
